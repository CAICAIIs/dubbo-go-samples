# LLM Models Configuration (Model-centric approach)
# Each model can have its own provider, URL, and API key
LLM_MODELS = llava:7b, qwen2.5:7b

# Default provider for all models (can be overridden per model)
LLM_PROVIDER = ollama
LLM_BASE_URL = http://localhost:11434

# API Key (required for cloud providers)
# LLM_API_KEY = your-api-key-here

# Legacy Configuration (for backward compatibility)
OLLAMA_URL = http://localhost:11434

# Server Configuration
MODEL_NAME = llava:7b
SERVER_PORT = 20020
NACOS_URL = nacos://localhost:8848
TIME_OUT_SECOND = 300
MAX_CONTEXT_COUNT = 3

# Example configurations for different scenarios:
# 
# Scenario 1: Multiple models from same provider (current approach)
# LLM_MODELS = gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-turbo
# LLM_PROVIDER = openai
# LLM_BASE_URL = https://api.openai.com/v1
# LLM_API_KEY = your-openai-api-key
# MODEL_NAME = gpt-4
#
# Scenario 2: Multiple models from different providers (future enhancement)
# LLM_MODELS = gpt-4, claude-3-sonnet, llava:7b
# LLM_PROVIDER = mixed
# MODEL_NAME = gpt-4
# # Each model would have its own configuration in the future
#
# Scenario 3: Local models with different endpoints
# LLM_MODELS = llava:7b, qwen2.5:7b, llama2:7b
# LLM_PROVIDER = ollama
# LLM_BASE_URL = http://localhost:11434
# MODEL_NAME = llava:7b
